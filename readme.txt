Adds an editor button that puts in an empty paragraph which won't get
deleted when you save.

== Description ==
This is a very simple plugin for the default (TinyMCE) editor. It adds
a button that puts in a paragraph which won't get deleted by the
linebreak-eater (the one that starts munching when you press
"Publish"). 

 
== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= But, typographically speaking, empty paragraphs suck! Why, oh why? =

Because sometimes people write poetry and don't care what typographers
think, and entering HTML code will just disrupt the flow.
